# League-of-Legends-winning-variables

This is a Notebook done in Jupyter using Python to analyse a dataset from the game League of Legends, the main goal is to see which 
variables contribute the most for a Team to win a match

for the notebook to run smoothly and read the dataset the file "high_diamond_ranked_10min.csv" must be in th same Folder as 
the python notebook "league of legends.ipynb"

Thank You,
